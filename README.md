# toboard
An alternative [Toggl](https://toggl.com/ "Toggl's Homepage") client, powered by the [official API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs "API's Repository")

The main idea is to have a dashboard with period specific goals and a way to visualize them.

I started [this project](https://github.com/rzfzr/toboard-legacy) in VueJS as it was my preferred framework, however I felt motiveted into switching after getting a abysmal result on Toggl's React test.
